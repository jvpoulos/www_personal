  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
  I am a postdoctoral fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, working on developing predictive models in medicine using electronic health records (EHRs). 
  Currently, I am leading a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) funded project that leverages deep learning techniques to predict diabetes treatment failure. 
  This involves creating advanced models, such as transformer neural networks, to analyze static and temporal features (e.g., diagnoses and lab results) and uncover patterns predictive of adverse outcomes.

  Beyond predictive modeling, my research spans multiple areas at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference. I work on extending causal inference methods for multi-valued treatments, 
  developing Bayesian frameworks for adversarial machine learning, and applying recurrent neural networks to panel data for causal impact estimation. 
  My work also includes evaluating deep learning approaches for missing data imputation in large-scale survey data.
