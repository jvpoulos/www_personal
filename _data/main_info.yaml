bio: "I am a postdoctoral fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical\
  \ School, working on developing predictive models in medicine using electronic health\
  \ records (EHRs). \nCurrently, I am leading a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research\
  \ Institute (PCORI) funded project that leverages deep learning techniques to predict\
  \ diabetes treatment failure. \nThis involves\
  \ creating advanced models, such as transformer neural networks, to analyze static\
  \ and temporal features (e.g., diagnoses and lab results) and uncover patterns predictive\
  \ of adverse outcomes.\n\nBeyond predictive modeling, my research spans multiple\
  \ areas at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference. I work on\
  \ extending causal inference methods for multi-valued treatments, developing Bayesian\
  \ frameworks for adversarial machine learning, and applying recurrent neural networks\
  \ to panel data for causal impact estimation. \nMy work also includes evaluating\
  \ deep learning approaches for missing data imputation in large-scale survey data.\n\
  \nThe goal of my research is to build more interpretable and clinically relevant\
  \ AI models, helping to advance personalized medicine and targeted interventions."
